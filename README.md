# RobustSurgeryPlanning_CCG

This repository contains a file pertaining to the dataset for surgery planning, addressing the robust surgery planning problem with considerations for surgery duration, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and emergency arrivals. The dataset comprises information on 99, 124, 149, and 174 patients across 10 operating rooms.

The second file is the code implemented for the two-stage robust location-transportation problem discussed in the following research article: "Solving two-stage robust optimization problems using a column-and-constraint generation method" for Julia users.
